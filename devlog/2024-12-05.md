## What I did

I started a new project, Dinner Spinner.
My brother came over to brainstorm my project and his simulation cockpit.

## What I learned

Sqlite migrations are a little funky, but can be made to work.
To create a migration script, run ```Add-Migration {migrationName}```
To run a migration script, first run ```dotnet ef migrations add {migrationName}``` to load up the migration then ```dotnet ef database update``` to execute the migration on the database.

## What I don't know

I kinda forgot how to do Dependency Injection, I want it so when I navigate to a page it automatically receives the vm to be used, but I haven't gotten to that stage so it's ok.

## What I want to do next

I need to device an update strategy so when migrations are practiced that a database in debug doesn't have its data cleared, just the schema changed. I am sure there's lots of documentation on that.
I'd like to quickly get data being read and written to the database to prove that section is done.
If the spinner could be 3D that'd be cool, but faily unnecessary.
