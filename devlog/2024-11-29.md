## What I did

I'm picking up a few things at a time. This is my 3rd svelte site I've ever made, and it may be my biggest, as tiny as it is.
I built a form that takes in a number and reports if it is prime. The custom math functions have unit tests.

## What I learned

It was tough getting the input field to trigger reactivity, `bind:value={inputNumber}` ended up being the trick.
I learned how to run vitests, it was pretty easy.
I learned how to format my code using npm commands.
I found a nice UI library, Flowbite.

## What I don't know

I don't fully understand $state and $derived runes, I can read that $state makes a variable reactive and $derived is a variable that uses the value of a $state, but it hasn't clicked yet.
Vitest delivered a template with the `describe` function by default, but if I toyed with it the line got crossed out and marked as deprecated.
There are 2 overrides for `describe`, maybe my modifications implemented the deprecated one, or maybe the whole describe function is going the way of the trackball.
I know my prime function is optimal, but I don't know if my square root function is optimal. It runs in O(log(n)) which is decent, but I wonder if there's some clever way to do it faster.
I think there's a way for VSCode to provide formatting inside the IDE, but I'm not sure.

## What I want to do next

I'd like to center these cards.
I'd like to get a nice background.
I'd like to get some animation on load.
I'd like to implement a dark mode toggle.
As far as showcasing my desktop skills, I suppose the best thing is to make a wpf app I guess. A backend that serves up data or acts as a chat service or both, but that's not wpf.
Perhaps I should implement the name spinner, or something called the "dinner spinner" that selects an item randomly out of a list.
It could have registration, login, and verified logins could submit and vote on places to go, and when the time comes either a moderator spins the spinner or it could be clock based.
