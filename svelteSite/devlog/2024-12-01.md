## What I did

In the morning I got the cards centered.
After church, I messed around with a timeline to quickly show employment history.
I spent some time fiddling with animations, and threw them away.
I put my resume onto the website.

## What I learned

Flex box and tailwind docs are my friend.
Animations probably should be used sparingly.
I learned how to export a UI component as a module.

## What I don't know

I don't kn0ow why I had to export my UI component with a bridging JS class, I suspect because I exposed a property using the word export.
I don't know how to set any element to use the full height of the screen, I've tried h-full, min-vh-100, making a class .full-height and setting height: 100%, I just can't get it.

## What I want to do next

Show a better background.
Build a fuller portfolio.
Put a home or back button on the resume page.
