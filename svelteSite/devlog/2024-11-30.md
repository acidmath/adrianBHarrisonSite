## What I did

I worked out in the morning which will pay off in the long run but ate into my energy budget for my coding tasks.
I turned in one leetcode solution and started another, and cleaned up the codebase a bit.

## What I learned

The first solution I had I did an iterative approach and got stuck, so I took a small 20 minute break and when I came back I solved it in just a few minutes with a recursive solution, so breaks are good.

## What I don't know

The second problem is tough, and I may need to look at an explanation of the answer, I don't know if the right thing to do is look now and get learning quickly, or to persist and create at least 1 working solution knowing that the answer explanation will probably include my solution and I can see what bad and good assumptions I made.

## What I want to do next

I wrote a comment explaining the code organization is not to my liking, with such a small codebase there's no excuse to not build it out as I like. Also, the problem numbers have changed so the naming scheme needs to change.
I'd like to standardize the comment documentation of each problem.
I'd like to solve at the minimum one problem each session.
